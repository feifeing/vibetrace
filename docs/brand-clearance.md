# PatchOath brand-clearance record

Recorded: **2026-09-04**

This document records the public naming screen used for the v0.3 project rename. It is an engineering/provenance record, not a legal opinion, trademark registration, or guarantee that no conflicting rights exist.

## Selected name

**PatchOath**

Primary positioning:

> **Make every AI patch prove it stayed in scope.**

The name maps directly to the product model:

- **Patch** — the code and visual effect actually produced by an AI-assisted change;
- **Oath** — the explicit human-declared boundary represented by a Change Contract; and
- **Proof** — Git objects, deterministic receipts, review records, and controlled-disclosure evidence used to check whether the observed effect stayed within that boundary.

`Oath` is a product metaphor for an explicit declared boundary. PatchOath does not claim that a Change Contract is a legal oath, cryptographic signature, identity credential, or guarantee of code correctness.

## Public-use screen

Before adopting the name, targeted exact-name searches were performed across publicly indexed sources and package/developer ecosystems, including:

- GitHub repository-name search;
- GitHub code search to distinguish exact brand use from substring matches;
- general web search for software products, companies, AI coding tools, security/developer tools, and commercial services;
- publicly indexed npm results;
- publicly indexed PyPI results;
- Product Hunt / product-launch results;
- public domain-use searches; and
- publicly indexed exact-name results associated with USPTO, WIPO, and EUIPO trademark sources.

At the time recorded above, those searches did **not identify an exact `PatchOath` software product, package, company, or clearly matching public trademark result**. GitHub repository-name search also returned no exact-name repository. GitHub code search results resembling the term were substring matches such as Android `PatchOatHeader` / `patchoat`, not an exact `PatchOath` product or identifier.

This is meaningful collision-reduction evidence, but it is not a substitute for a professional jurisdiction/class-specific trademark clearance search before significant commercialization.

## Why the previous working name was retired

The earlier working name **VibeTrace** had material public overlap before this repository adopted it as a long-term brand. The project's related-work and legal records document earlier exact or near-exact software/developer-tool uses, including an existing `vibetrace` npm package and multiple public projects/services using VibeTrace/Vibetrace naming.

The rename therefore reduces avoidable product-name confusion while preserving historical compatibility for previously generated local evidence.

## Candidates rejected during the same screen

The following candidates were deliberately not adopted because public searches found existing or adjacent uses, weak distinctiveness, or an undesirable collision surface:

| Candidate | Reason rejected |
| --- | --- |
| PromptLatch | Existing LLM/security tooling use |
| DriftLatch | Existing commercial product use |
| ScopeProof | Multiple active product/software uses |
| ScopeLatch | Existing public software/type usage; weak uniqueness |
| PatchMandate / Mandate family | `patch mandate` is established security/compliance language and Mandate has adjacent agent-authorization use |
| Warrant family | Existing AI-agent evidence/attestation product use and adjacent `Change Warrant` terminology |
| PatchSigil / Sigil family | Existing Sigil software brand and weaker search distinctiveness |
| PatchPact | Existing contract-first GitHub/developer project with close conceptual overlap |
| ScopePact | Existing agent authority/receipt product use |
| PromptPact | Existing public name/application use |

The purpose of this list is provenance and future naming discipline, not an allegation that any listed project owns a broad software concept.

## Compatibility policy

The new public product identity is PatchOath, but v0.3 intentionally keeps historical evidence verifiable:

```text
new local store      .patchoath/
legacy local store   .vibetrace/        (read compatibility)

new Git refs         refs/patchoath/...
legacy Git refs      refs/vibetrace/... (verification compatibility)

new checkpoint IDs   po_...
new evidence IDs     poe_...
new delta IDs        pocd_...
new disclosure IDs   pod_...
new review IDs       por_...
```

Legacy `vt_`, `vtr_`, `vtcd_`, `vtd_`, and `vrr_` evidence remains a compatibility concern and must not be silently invalidated merely to make the repository appear fully renamed.

The legacy `vibetrace` CLI name is retained only as a deprecated migration shim during the v0.3 compatibility window. New documentation and examples use `patchoath`.

## Release boundary

The package remains private during the migration and final technical audit. Making the npm package public, registering a trademark, purchasing domains, or relying on the name for significant commercial investment should remain explicit decisions rather than side effects of a code rename.

For commercial release, a qualified professional should perform a jurisdiction- and class-specific trademark clearance/FTO review appropriate to the intended markets. No statement in this repository should be read as a guarantee of non-infringement.
