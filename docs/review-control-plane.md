# Review Control Plane

PatchOath separates five stages that are easy to blur together in AI-assisted coding:

```text
Intent → Authority → Effect → Review → Disclosure
```

The stages are deliberately different kinds of evidence.

| Stage      | Question                                                              | Evidence type                                      |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Intent     | What did the prompt appear to ask for?                                | Transparent heuristic context                      |
| Authority  | What did the developer explicitly allow?                              | User-declared Change Contract                      |
| Effect     | What actually changed?                                                | Git objects + optional visual evidence             |
| Review     | What does this exact historical effect imply for human review?        | Mechanical delta + separate historical review     |
| Disclosure | What evidence is permitted to leave the local review context?         | Explicit Disclosure Policy + Evidence Capsule      |

## Why add a review plane?

Authorization Drift is a useful stop signal, but it does not answer the next review question:

> If a human really intends to accept this exact already-observed effect, what narrowly expressible change to the original contract would be sufficient?

`patchoath contract-delta` answers the **mechanical** part of that question inside an intentionally restricted proposal vocabulary.

It may propose:

- an exact observed path that fell outside an existing allow scope;
- a file budget raised only to the exact observed file count;
- a changed-line budget raised only to the exact observed total; or
- a module budget raised only to the exact observed module count.

It never proposes:

- removing an explicit deny rule;
- unprotecting a sensitive surface;
- replacing an exact observed path with a broader glob; or
- applying or persisting the candidate contract.

A protected-path or protected-surface violation therefore remains a human-review blocker even when a mechanical delta can be computed for other parts of the same change.

## Mechanical proposal and human review are different records

PatchOath deliberately does **not** treat a mechanically sufficient Contract Delta as a human decision.

The two layers are separate:

```text
Contract Delta
  “what narrow candidate would cover this exact observed effect?”

Historical Effect Review
  “what did a human record about this already-captured effect?”
```

`patchoath review --accept-effect` records only acceptance of that historical effect. It does not mutate the Change Contract or grant the coding agent authority for a future action.

The Dashboard is read-only for this human-review layer. It can display an existing record and its integrity state, but it does not provide an approval button that can silently change authority.

## The observed effect is recomputed

The report does not use cached `analysis.files` as authority for Contract Delta.

When a standalone report is generated, PatchOath:

1. recomputes the checkpoint's Evidence Receipt and refuses derived review proposals if that receipt no longer matches;
2. reads the receipt-bound before/after Git object IDs;
3. recomputes the actual Git diff from those objects;
4. evaluates the original Change Contract against that recomputed effect; and
5. computes the restricted local Contract Delta and counterfactual replay from that same effect.

This is important because a UI cache, report summary, or stored file list should not be able to manufacture a permission recommendation that the Git evidence does not support.

The Dashboard therefore reports verification scope precisely:

- **Source receipt verified** means the deterministic Evidence Receipt currently recomputes;
- **Git effect recomputed** means the before/after object pair was diffed again for the Review Plane;
- neither statement means every check performed by `patchoath verify` necessarily ran inside report generation.

For example, `patchoath verify` additionally checks referenced private refs and available visual artifact bytes. The Review Plane does not collapse those separate checks into a generic “trusted” badge.

## Counterfactual replay is not approval

A Contract Delta can be evaluated against the same already-observed effect:

```text
original contract + observed effect → violated
candidate contract + same effect   → compliant
```

When the second evaluation is compliant, PatchOath can label the restricted proposal `proposal-ready`.

That means only:

> the candidate is sufficient for this exact historical effect inside PatchOath's restricted proposal language.

It does **not** mean:

- the change is safe;
- the code is correct;
- the developer should approve it;
- the agent should receive this authority in the future; or
- the proposal is a globally minimal access-control policy.

The Proposal Receipt (`pocd_*`) is likewise an integrity record over the source receipt, original contract, recomputed effect, delta, blockers, and replay result. It is not an approval token.

## The browser report is full local evidence

A PatchOath standalone browser report is designed for local review. It can contain sensitive material such as:

- full prompt text;
- changed file paths;
- Change Contract patterns;
- screenshots;
- DOM/layout evidence; and
- other checkpoint metadata.

Therefore:

> **A browser report is not a share-safe Evidence Capsule.**

The Dashboard intentionally says this explicitly rather than presenting a “share” button that silently exports the current page.

Use a separate minimum-disclosure Capsule when evidence needs to leave the local review context:

```bash
patchoath capsule <checkpoint>
```

By default the Capsule omits:

```text
promptText
filePaths
contractPatterns
gitPatch
visualArtifactBytes
```

Expanded disclosure requires explicit CLI flags. Capsule construction uses an allowlist projection rather than cloning a checkpoint and attempting to redact it afterward, so newly added checkpoint fields do not become shareable automatically.

The Disclosure Receipt (`pod_*`) binds the source Evidence Receipt, disclosure-policy hash, and disclosed projection hash. It is not encryption, anonymity, a digital signature, or a zero-knowledge proof.

## Two independent authority boundaries

The resulting architecture has two separate authority questions:

```text
Execution authority
  Change Contract
      ↓
  Did the observed effect cross the declared coding boundary?

Disclosure authority
  Disclosure Policy
      ↓
  Did the exported evidence cross the declared sharing boundary?
```

The first protects developer work from unintended execution scope. The second reduces accidental over-disclosure of the evidence collected to review that work.

Keeping them separate is more important than giving either one a clever name: a tool can enforce a coding boundary correctly and still leak sensitive review evidence, or disclose a carefully minimized evidence package about a change that was never authorized in the first place.

## Non-novelty boundary

Least privilege, step-up authorization, access-control policy repair, evidence packs, selective disclosure, cryptographic hashes, receipts, signed attestations, and human approval logs all have substantial prior art.

PatchOath does not claim those primitives as inventions.

The project-specific design being developed is their disciplined composition into one local AI-code-change evidence workflow in which:

- inferred intent is not permission;
- execution authority is explicit;
- observed effect is recomputed from Git evidence for review proposals;
- protected boundaries are never automatically relaxed from observed effect alone;
- counterfactual sufficiency is separated from human approval;
- a historical human review cannot silently become future execution authority; and
- evidence-disclosure authority is modeled separately from execution authority.
